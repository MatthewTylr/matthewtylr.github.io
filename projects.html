<b>Computational Modeling of Ebola Using Flight Routes as Transmission Vectors</b>
</p><p>
Starting during the summer of 2014, Nicholas A. Yager and I wanted to continue our work from our earlier project _Epidemiology of the Airways_. Instead of using predefined routes, we instead collected data with the permission of FlightAware. Various metrics were recorded, such as: time of flight, type of airplane, departing airport, and destination to name a few. We then combined this information with a list of airports given specific ICAO names for each airport, which we could then link to specific GPS coordinates. This allowed us to use a gridded populaton of the world dataset, provided by NASA, and associate airports with specific metropolitan areas. This allowed us to develop a metapopulation network where we could simulate disease and study it's propagation.
</p><p>
For COPLAC 2014, held at Keene State on November 7th and 8th, we wanted to assess whether or not reported R0 values, the basic reproductive number of a disease, for the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak were in line with our "globalized model." In order to validate the model, we used parameters from the 1976 Yambuku, Zaire Ebola outbreak and simulated a current outbreak. By generating a statistically non-different R0 value, we believed that our model would be able to accurate generate an R0 value for the 2014 West African Ebola Outbreak. We found that our basic reproductive number was statistically greater than some of the early estimates (usually about ~1.8) and was approximately 2.1. The poster is avaliable in this [folder](https://github.com/MatthewTylr/matthewtylr.github.io/tree/master/projects) for viewing if you wish!
</p><p>
Furthermore, we wanted to apply this model to answer some questions about how Ebola could possibly propagate internationally. We briefly examined hospitalization rate in order to determine what level of aid would be needed to prevent a pandemic from occuring. This yeilded some interesting results, mainly suggesting that hospitalization rate that was reported during the early outbreak was likely higher than the actual hospitalization rate (something that was also mentioned in the World Health Organization's Ebola Response Roadmap). We also are working on debunking whether or not banning flights from the affected regions to the United States would have altered the propagation of the disease internationally, should the situation in the West Africa continue to deteriorate.
</p><p>
Additionally, the power of this model is it's ability to be adapted to different diseases that are capable of spreading via airplanes. In the past we have been motivated by SARS, and even recently we could use our model to examine the possibility of MERS spreading in much the same way. We have also looked at Flu, although it bogs down the model quite a bit. Currently we are able to simulate 4.8 billion people!

<b>Modeling the Chromosomes in _Epulopiscium spp_</b>
</p><p>
During the Fall Semester 2014, Nicholas A. Yager and I, under the guidance of Dr. Elizabeth Hutchison, wanted to count the number of chromosomes in an _Epulopiscium spp_, which is a large bacterium (can reach lengths of 600Âµm) that is extremely polyploid (1000+ chromosomal copies). Due to the size of the cell, multiple chromosomal copies are necessary for the _Epulopiscium spp_ to translate enough proteins to counteract the large amount of cellular space.
</p><p>
We were interested in the maturation of daughter cells, and how their relative chromosomal densities may differ during their life cycle. A z-stack of fluorescence microscopy images were provided to us by Dr. Hutchison, and these were able to be converted to digital coordinates by using the cv2 python package. By doing this we could examine the spatial distribution of the chromosomes throughout the cells and calculate their density.

<b>Analysis of Controlled Burns on the Biodiversity at Rush Oak Openings</b>
</p><p>
This project was completed for my Conservation Biology course. Working with Dr. Kristina Hannam, Dr. James Kernan, and students from the Biogeography course, we visited the Rush Oaks site in Rush, NY to collect data on the vegetation present at various locations. This included five forest plots and five 50m transects that were verified via GPS. Using common tests, like Robel Pole Measurements and Diameter at Breat Height (DBH), we were able to quantify these various locations.
</p><p>
Then Dr. Kernan allowed us access to historical data about controlled burns at the Rush Oaks site, that was stored in ArcGIS. Rush Oaks is often "treated" with prescribed fire due to the type of ecosystem usually referred to as an "Oak Savannah." Then we were able to assign specific species distributions and compositions to the burn histories and burn frequencies of the sites.
</p><p>
Then using the information that we had collected as a class, we were instructed to "find something interesting." Because of the flexibility of the assignment, I was able to do two main things: (a) produce a publication quality research paper by using LaTeX, and (b) finally be able to perform a DECORANA or Detrended Correlation Analysis (DCA) due to the nature of the data. From this I was able to infer species compositions based on the relative abundance of other species. For example, for this particular ecosystem it seemed as though the precense Wild Bergemot was exclusively related to the precense of Indiangrass.

<b>Topography of a Simple SIR Model from Altering Basic Parameters</b>
</p><p>
A small project that I persued by myself was what I want to call the "Topography of a Simple SIR Model." I was motivated to understand how altering the initial parameters, rewiring coefficient and connectivity, alter the amount of people that were ultimately infected. Using a Watts-Strogatz network model consisting of 500 individuals, relationships were randomly generated using given parameters. The graph above shows the results from the simulations, with a white to black color scheme acting as a three dimensional representation of the final number of infected individuals at the end of each simulation. I would expect that with more replications, the gradient would be much smoother.

<b>Epidemiology of the Airways</b>
</p><p>
During the Spring Semester of Fall 2014, Nicholas A. Yager and I worked on a project that would eventually inspire the Computational Modeling of Ebola project we would present at COPLAC. Using airport and flight data provided by openflights.org, we constructed a network model to simulate the spread of a generic disease by using flight paths as transmission vectors.
</p><p>
We investigated the closure of both airports and flight routes as possible methods to prevent the pathogen from spreading. For airports we found that closing 30% of the highest degree airports usually resulted in less than one percent of the airports becoming infectious. Cancelling air routes seemed a more viable technique to reduce the amount of airports that would harbor the disease. We used several cancellation techniques based on network structure to accomplish this: betweenness, clustering coefficient, and random. We found that different levels of cancellation effort gave different results for which strategy would work the best. However, generally the trend was a 1:1 linear dicrease by using betweenness values for the cancellation strategy. This meant that closing the top 50% of routes ranked by betweenness would reduce the incidence by 50% as well.
</p><p>
We also investigated how delaying the implementation of cancellation strategies would affect the outcome. We found that cancellation measures should be implemented within about a week to maintain their effectiveness. We presented our work at Geneseo's GREAT (Geneseo Recognizing Excellence, Achievement and Talent) Day to a public audience, and that presentation can be found in this [folder](https://github.com/MatthewTylr/matthewtylr.github.io/tree/master/projects). If you are interested in the code, we have made it public via [GitHub](https://github.com/nicholasyager/airport-disease-modeling), and you should clone it and play around with it if you are interested!

<b>Effect of Transgenic Mosquitos on the Gene Frequency of the Sickle Cell Trait in West Sub-Saharan Africa</b>
</p><p>
During Spring 2014, students of the Modeling Biological Systems class led by Dr. Chris Leary of the Mathematics Department and Dr. Gregg Hartvigsen of the Biology Department, challenged us to model the spread of Malaria and to implement measures to reduce it's incidence. We used a paper by Marrelli et al., that dealt with the creation of transgenic mosquitos to influence our treatment design.
</p><p>
We felt that transgenic mosquitos would be an extremely effective treatment because it would accomplish two goals: (a) reduce the number of mosquitos carrying Malaria due to a slight advantage and (b) reduce the number of individuals in the population with Sickle Cell due to effectively nullifying the heterozygotic advantage. We found that transgenic mosquitos would affect the number of individuals in the population with Sickle Cell, and that the results of our experiment differ greatly depending on the number of transgenics that are released into the environment.

<b>Modeling the Outbreak of the Plague</b>
</p><p>
During Spring 2014, Cortney Dodge, Matt Strassman, and I wanted to model an outbreak of the Black Death in modern times. We felt that this topic was still applicable due to recent outbreaks of the Plague and due to the fact that the incidence of the microbe, _Y. Pestis_, is high in various storage facilities here in the United States. We wanted to test various strategies if there was ever another large outbreak here in the states.
</p><p>
We found that the Black Death was particularly, well, deadly. However, we discovered that the best method, taking into consideration the limitations of their implementations, would be a systematic live rat removal plan. We also discovered using a lattice based spatial model, that the disease is sensitive to spacial restrictions. This explains why Milan (who basically closed off their city) and Poland (who was effectively isolated from the rest of Europe) did not suffer outbreaks of the Black Death. It also lends credence to the theory that the Black Death was so deadly because of the infrastructure at the time. We presented our work at GREAT Day, and the presentation can be found in this [folder](https://github.com/MatthewTylr/matthewtylr.github.io/tree/master/projects).

<b>Pollination Dynamics</b>
</p><p>
During Fall Semester of 2013, Nicholas A. Yager, Andy Patt, and I worked on pollination dynamics and how a certain distribution of bee species may adversely affect the concentration of various plant species in a given area. We generally found that this happened to be the case, and confirmed the ecological theory that when two species are in competition one always wins.
